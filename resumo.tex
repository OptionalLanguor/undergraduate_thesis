In order to bring a sense of security and reliability to an autonomous vehicle passenger, this work elaborates and develops a system that uses computer graphics techniques to provide an estimated 3D representation of environments captured by stereo cameras. The proposed system has as input stereo camera images and a semantic image that maps and differs types of objects in a scene. Our proposal estimates the 3D environment outputting 3D representations of objects in the captured environment. Two algorithm approach methods have been developed, one with focus on computer vision for feature extraction and other focused on computer graphics for the representation of entities in a scene. The first system named Cloud Analysis obtained satisfactory qualitative results on feature extraction on generated disparity images and point clouds, the second system named 3D environment was developed with a compact stack approach in mind for the representation of real-world scenes, qualitative results are shown with tailored baseline projections and inputs from the first system feature extractor.
