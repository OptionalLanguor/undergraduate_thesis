\chapter{Conclusion} \label{final_considerations}

%This version goal is to help tailor writing and correct vision mistakes on the project course. It is known by the authors that the content shown here is not perfect, nor is its exposure. But it's intended to collect feedback and suggestions for the final version of this document, such as more recommended literature and different approaches to those presented here and the ones being proposed in the future steps.

%The research is still ongoing. However, it is possible to have conclusions on the progress made. Future steps will also be listed during this chapter.

%\section{Conclusion}\label{conclusao}

It's possible to affirm that an end-to-end version of the proposed system was properly elaborated \& developed, and that the set goals of the research were achieved. However, better results for the visualization were expected when considering that only one semantic class had to exist to enable feature extraction. Thus, limiting the number of test scenarios and variety in the 3D environment representation.

For better performance of the first system, a more elaborate method that could be explored in future work would be to consider clustering entities with the same semantic image information. Thus, still making use of the advantageous semantic information offered by the autonomous-driving algorithm for its decision making, and now considering more than one entity with the same semantic class in a scene. A second point of improvement would be to explore approaches to reduce point cloud noise by using more elaborate depth estimation methods.

To enhance the second system results, future work could involve conducting tests on real embedded systems for autonomous-driving while profiling the software performance, and optimizing it when needed. A parallel approach could involve the building of a display prototype to receive real users feedback and evaluation. 

Finally, an approach on surveillance and monitoring could be explored and evaluated. Possibly considering the use o sensors from more than one vehicle connected by network, and also exploring the possibility of map update following the graphical display procedure achieved in this research.


%\section{Future Work}\label{trabalhos_futuros}


%    With the end of this first stage of development, note some important steps that must be taken in this next research phase. Regarding the first point cloud analysis system, the following points should be worked: Use the variance model to obtain the most efficient object size in the scene; to study ways to generate an approximate plane equivalent to the plane of the street and sidewalk, beside to study ways to deduce the direction of vehicles from the cloud information points we have. Regarding the second system, you must find ways to convert the coordinate format that the environment receives in a format that makes sense in the developed 3D environment. If it is possible, there is also a desire to be able to discriminate different objects within the same category of the semantic image.
